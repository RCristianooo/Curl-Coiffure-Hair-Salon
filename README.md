Curl & Coiffure is a Hair Salon located in Gulfport, Florida. I made this site for them to receive more clients, allowing themselves to introduce the team, their story, and finally a way to communicate to their clients.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We first started with how they wanted the design to look like. The color palette of white, black, and red pink. We then proceeded to decide what should be included in a simple site dedicated to a hair salon. A customer should know the hours and a way to get a hold of the business, so we needed a page to contact the hair salon that included their number and a form to submit bookings and questions. Next, we needed infomation about the hair salon. It was deemed necessary for the owner to talk about themselves and now they got started. Thus, Our Story page was made. Finally, people should get to know about the stylists. The Our Team page was then introduced to showcase each and every stylist including a short bio about them. This website was created in a simply beautiful manner, and I am really happy to see this come to life. 

## Optimizations

The owner wanted something so they could appear more in searches. Which means, they wanted the website as soon as possible to start getting more clients. While I had to work quite close to deadline, the site appears great. Although if the owner did not need the website immediately and was given more time, I believe we would had agreed to add more content to the site. What I believe could have been added, is a page dedicated to selling hair, skincare, and make-up products. Perhaps gift cards for potentially returning clients? A career section for people interesting in pursuing a career at Curl & Coiffure as a stylist.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned quite a lot by working with my very first client. She was eager to show her business to the digital world and it taught me a lot on how to communicate efficently with a client that had goals in mind. I have learned Seperation of Concerns by noticing how easy to know that there's a section each for content, structure, styling and behavior.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
