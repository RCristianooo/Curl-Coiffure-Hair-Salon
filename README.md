# Curl Coiffure Hair Salon
Curl & Coiffure, a hair salon nestled in Gulfport, Florida, was created as a website aimed at attracting more clients. The site serves as a platform for them to showcase their team, share their story, and provide an effective means of communication with their clients.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

We began by defining the design aesthetics, settling on a color palette of white, black, and red-pink for Curl & Coiffure. Next, we focused on essential elements for a hair salon website, ensuring clients could easily access important information. A dedicated 'Contact' page was designed, featuring a form for bookings and inquiries. Recognizing the importance of providing background information, we created an 'Our Story' page, allowing the owner to share the salon's journey.

To personalize the experience further, we introduced an 'Our Team' page to showcase each stylist with a brief bio. The site, designed in a simple yet beautiful manner, aims to meet the practical needs of clients while offering an engaging insight into the salon's identity. Witnessing this project come to life has been truly fulfilling.

## Optimizations

The owner's priority was to boost online visibility quickly, necessitating a swift website launch for immediate client acquisition. Despite a tight deadline, the site looks impressive. Given more time, potential additions could have included a page for retailing products, offering gift cards, and introducing a career section for aspiring stylists at Curl & Coiffure.

## Lessons Learned:

Working with my client, who was eager to showcase their business digitally, was a valuable learning experience. It taught me efficient client communication and the importance of understanding their goals. I also gained insights into separation of concerns, realizing the clarity it brings to structuring content, styling, and behavior in distinct sections.
